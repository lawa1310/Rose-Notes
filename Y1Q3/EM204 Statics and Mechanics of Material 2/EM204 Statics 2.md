# What is Statics 2?

Statics 2 serves as an extension of the content covered in Statics 1. It aims to cover Strength and elastic deflection of engineering materials due to loads applied in torsion, bending, and in shear.

# What are the Learning Outcomes?
- Identify the likely locations of highest stress of a loaded beam, shaft, or tension member
- Use definitions of stress and strain to calculate stress and strain values in engineering problems
- Determine bending and shear stress at a point in a uniform cross-section beam with both distributed and concentrated loads
- Determine deflection of a beam at a point in a uniform cross-section beam for different types of loading
- Determine bending and torsional stresses in a circular cross-section shaft with both concentrated loads and torques
- Determine deflections of a circular cross-section shaft with both concentrated loads and torques
- Determine the principal stresses and strains from the known stresses at a point
- Perform stress transformations in plane stress loading and check answers with [[Mohr's Circle]]
- Calculate stresses at a point on an object subject to arbitrary loading
- Calculate critical buckling loads

# Why Study Statics 2?

Statics 1 covered just the basics of material loading. As seen in GPE, the primary mode of failure for stressed components will be due to bending(buckling) loads. By developing an understanding of worst-case load scenarios, we can build safer, more robust designs.
