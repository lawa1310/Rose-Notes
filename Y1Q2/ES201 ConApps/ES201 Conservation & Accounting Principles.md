# What is ES201 (Con Apps?)
ConApps serves as the introduction to several higher level courses at Rose-Hulman. It lays the groundwork for other courses, such as ME 301 (Applications of Thermodynamics), ES 214 (Mechanical Systems), and ES 205 (Analysis and Design of Engineering Systems, or ADES).

# Why ConApps?
"The engineering sciences have traditionally been taught in separate, independent courses. In taking this approach, similarities between the various subjects were often obscured. Because of this, students failed to appreciate the significant common threads that run through all of these courses. The goal of this course and the Sophomore Engineering Curriculum is to help you see similarities between various subjects... In doing this, we believe you will be better engineers."

Essentially, ConApps serves to bridge the gap between several other high-level courses and provide the common fundamentals of all of them.

# So what does ConApps cover?
ConApps is generally broken into 4 units:
1. [[Conservation of Mass]] (CoM)
2. [[Conservation of Linear/Angular Momentum]] (CoLM/CoAM)
3. [[Conservation of Energy]] (CoE)
4. [[Accounting of Entropy]] (AoS)
Each of these units deals with a different property that a system can possess and the different transformations that said property can go through. All of this is built off of the fundamental [[Accounting Principles]]. These principles are the basis of everything that will be covered in this class. Additionally, [[Helpful Terminology]] is a non-exhaustive list of all of the terminology used in the class
