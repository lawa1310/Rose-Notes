# Core Terminology for ES 201
1. Model 
	1. A representation of something that we wish to analyze
2. System
	1. Any region of space or quantity of matter set aside for analysis
3. Surrounding
	1. Anything that is outside of the system boundary
4. System Boundary
	1. An imaginary or real border that separates your system from the surrounding
	2. Also often called a *control surface*
5. Open System
	1. A system in which mass can cross the system boundary
		1. Volume ($\forall$) can be constant or vary with time
6. Closed System
	1. A system with a fixed amount of matter
		1. Matter cannot cross the system boundary
		2. There can be other types of boundary interactions (forces, moments)
7. Isolated System
	1. A system with no interaction to the surroundings
8. Property
	1. Any characteristic of a system that can be assigned a numerical value at a specified time
9. Extensive Property
	1. Any property that depends upon the extent of the system.
		1. Volume, Mass, Momentum, Energy
	2. Extensive properties are additive
10. Intensive Properties
	1. Any property that does *NOT* depend on the extent of the system.
		1. Pressure, Density, Temperature
	2. Intensive properties are *NOT* additive
11. State
	1. A complete description of a system in terms of each of its properties
12. "Steady-State"
	1. A condition where the properties of a system are independent of time
	2. Represented by $\frac{d[\quad]}{dt}=0$
13. Dimension
	1. The nature or description of a physical quantity
		1. Mass, length, etc.
	2. A **Fundamental Dimension** is a set of independent dimensions that can be used to represent all physical quantities
	3. A **Derived Dimension** is a dimension that can be expressed in terms of a set of fundamental dimensions
14. Units
	1. The standard for measuring a dimension
		1. Ton, meter, Joule, etc.
	2. A **Fundamental Unit** is a standard unit for measuring a fundamental dimension
		1. Kilogram (kg) for mass, Meter (m) for length, Second (s) for time
	3. A **Derived Unit** is a standard for measuring a derived dimension
