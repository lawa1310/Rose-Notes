# Fundamental Dimension: Mass
Mass is a measure of an amount of matter. It is an extensive property (it depends on the amount of stuff in the system) and it is conserved. Thus, there can be no generation or destruction terms in the fundamental accounting principle when applied to a system's mass. The units of mass are the *Newton(N)* in SI (Standard International) Units, and the *Pound Mass (lbm)* or the *slug* in the USCS (United States Customary System).

## Derived Dimension: Density
Density is a measure of how much mass occupies a unit of space. The *Bulk*, or mean density of a system, $\rho$, is given by the following equation: $$\rho = \frac{\forall}{m} \tag{1}$$
Density, unlike mass, is an intensive property. It does not depend on the amount of matter in the system. The units for density are $kg/m^3$ for SI and $slug/ft^3$ or $lbm/ft^3$ for USCS. 

Specific volume is the volume per unit mass of a system. It is given as the reciprocal of density, or: $$\nu = \frac{\forall}{m} = \frac{1}{\rho} \tag{2}$$
Specific weight is the weight per unit volume of a system. It is given as: $$\gamma = \frac{w}{\forall} = \frac{mg}{\forall} = \rho g \tag{3}$$
Specific gravity is the ratio of material density to that of water:
$$S.G. = \frac{\rho}{\rho_{H_{2}O,stp}} \tag{4}$$
If a system is declared to be *incompressible*, it is assumed that the density of the system, $\rho$ is constant over time and uniform throughout the system.
# Conservation of Mass
Given that mass is a conserved property, there can be no creation or destruction terms in the fundamental accounting principle. Thus, the finite form of the Conservation of Mass (CoM) is given as: $$m_{sys,final}-m_{sys,initial} = \Delta m = \Sigma \dot m_{in} - \Sigma \dot m_{out} \tag{5}$$
